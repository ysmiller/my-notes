Welcome to my Quartz page!

## 🪴 What am I looking at?

I have been running Obsidian for the past year and have been looking for ways to post my notes online in a streamlined way. Here you'll find pages related to my teaching, research, and publications.

##  ✏️  Current Writing Projects

Right now I'm finishing up an article about texts that portray the biblical Elijah as a priest (*kohen*). This is an outgrowth of my work on Phinehas, about whom I am finishing a monograph. More on that shortly!


## 🎒 Current Teaching

This semester I'm teaching a course entitled "Palestine Under Greeks and Romans," and I hope to post regular content relating to the class. In the meantime, my first Quartz page is a list of digital resources for students in this class.
